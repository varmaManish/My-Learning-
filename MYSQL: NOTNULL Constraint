Q: What is NotNull Constraint ?

NOTNULL is contraint that is use for making the column connot be the empty while inserting the values in the table 
and this is the bestPractice for creating the table 

Querry:Create Table Table_name ( col_1 int NOTNULL , Col_2 varchar);
Example: Create table Employee(Emp_code int NOTNULL,Emp_name Varchar (20));

Now this the demonstration for while creating table in the intial Stage IF we have the 
Already existing Table and then wants to make any specific column to be NOTNULL
then we should have to do Alter operations

Querry:Alter Table Table_name Modify column Col_1 int NOTNULL;
Example: ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE MODIFY COLUMN EMP_CODE INT NOTNULL ;

Now Above querry will make 'EMP_CODE' column to the NOTNULL 
also this use only while you have the pre-existing Table
