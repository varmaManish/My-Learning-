Asccending (ASC) keyword is use for make the order of the output would be in asccending order

Querry: Select * from Table_name where col_1=col_2 order by col_1 ASC;

this Querry will give the output in asscending order by column_1

Example:Select EMP_code from Employee where EMP_code>3 order by EMP_code ASC;
 this example clearly demostrate that the the output would be based on the EMP_code
in Assending order but there is contiional statement says that the EMP_code would be Greater than 3
so output would be start form the 3

Now if you use DSC key instead of ASC So this DSC keyword use for dessending order of the outcome 
like here OUPUT would  be start form the 3,4,5.... like but if you use DSC keyword 
Start like n-1,n-2,.... like this use this keyword as per the requirement with 'order by'
