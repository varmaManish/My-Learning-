Primary key contraint is a combined of two constraint which is 'NOTNULL' and 'UNIQUE'
constraint.
primary constraint is typically used for maintain the integrity and build a relation between a table

Querry: Create table Table_name ( COl_1 int primary key ,COL_2 varchar (20) );

this is the genral method of using primary contraint while making the table
But,you have already a Already exiistinf table then use alter technique to implement the primary key constraint

Querry: Alter table table add constraint primary key( col_name);
